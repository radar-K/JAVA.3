// Loops allow you to execute code repeatedly based on a condition.

// Task 1: Write a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.

// Task 2: Create a while loop that prints the numbers 10 to 15.

// Task 3. Write for-loop that loops through the array `numbers`
// compare every number with the variable `lowest`.
// If the number is lower than `lowest` update `lowest` to the current number
// Use console.log to print `lowest`.
const numbers = [9, 10, 17, 34, 2, 4, 100];
let lowest = numbers[0];

// Task 4, Write a function `getLowest` that takes an array of numbers as
// input and returns the lowest number.
