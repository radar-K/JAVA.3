// This stretch goal assignment will challenge your understanding of the spread operator, destructuring,
// loops, truthiness and filtering.

// Starting Data
const student = { name: "Alex", age: 20, grades: [85, 90, 78] };
const course = {
  title: "JavaScript Basics",
  duration: "3 months",
  instructor: {
    firstName: "Sara",
    lastName: "Jones",
  },
};
const numbers = [0, 15, -3, 9, null, 22, undefined, 8, NaN, false, 100];

// Task 1: Object Manipulation
// Use the spread operator to create a new object called `updatedStudent`, updating the age to 21
// and adding a new property `major` with the value "Computer Science".
// Log `updatedStudent` to the console.

// Task 2: Nested Destructuring
// Use nested destructuring to extract the firstName and lastName of the instructor from the `course` object
// into variables `instructorFirstName` and `instructorLastName`.
// Log `instructorFirstName` and `instructorLastName` to the console.

// Task 3: Filtering and Truthiness
// Write a function called `filterValidNumbers` that filters out all falsy values and any negative numbers
// from the `numbers` array.
// Call `filterValidNumbers` with `numbers` and log the result to the console.

// Task 4: Loop with Conditionals
// Write a function called `analyzeStudentGrades` that takes an object representing a student
// (with properties `name` and `grades` - an array of numbers) and calculates the average grade.
// If the average is above 85, print "Excellent performance, [Student Name]!".
// If it's between 70 and 85, print "Good job, [Student Name]!".
// If it's below 70, print "[Student Name], you need to improve.".
// Call `analyzeStudentGrades` with the `updatedStudent` object.
